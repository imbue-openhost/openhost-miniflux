"""OpenHost auth proxy sidecar for Miniflux.

Sits between the OpenHost router and Miniflux. Verifies the visitor's
`zone_auth` JWT cookie (signed by the OpenHost router with RS256, published
at /.well-known/jwks.json on the router) and, when the claim `sub == "owner"`,
stamps an `X-Openhost-User: admin` header on the proxied request.

Miniflux is configured with AUTH_PROXY_HEADER=X-Openhost-User, so a valid
stamped header authenticates the owner as the `admin` Miniflux user. On the
first such request, Miniflux auto-creates the admin account
(AUTH_PROXY_USER_CREATION=1). DISABLE_LOCAL_AUTH=1 hides the password form.

Why not trust `X-OpenHost-Is-Owner`? The OpenHost router passes client-supplied
headers through to apps on public paths and overwrites X-OpenHost-Is-Owner only
for authenticated owners. Non-owner visitors to a public path (Miniflux's
`/healthcheck` is listed in `openhost.toml`'s `public_paths`) could forge the
header. We mirror the mirotalk pattern — verify a signed JWT ourselves — so the
app stays safe regardless of which paths are public.

We deliberately strip any incoming X-Openhost-User header on every request so
that a hostile upstream or client cannot inject auth by setting it themselves.
Miniflux's TRUSTED_REVERSE_PROXY_NETWORKS is also set to 127.0.0.1/32 so only
this sidecar's stamped header is honored.
